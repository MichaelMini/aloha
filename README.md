# Aloha - A single page website ( HTML5, CSS and jQuery )

First Project for RED Academy - Full-Time Web Developer Professional

## Project Description - http://michaelmini.github.io/aloha-HTML5-CSS3/index.html

The first project at RED Academy Full-Time Web Developer Professional. It is to build a front page for a E-commerce store by writing HTML5, CSS and jQuery from scratch. The main functionalities of the Aloha site are Smooth Scrolling (jQuery), bxslider (jQuery), Flexbox (css3), media query (css) and form/input elements (HTML5). 

The navigation menu encorporates with jQuery - smooth scrolling and the 'Featured' section tag uses the bxslider. Which allows the user auto scroll to different part of the page by click on the menu and buttons.

The Flexbox and media query allow the website to be responsive to different layout and style depending on the screen size of the user's device. 

The form and input elements can be used to validate if an proper email had been entered into the submission box by the user.

## Summary 

It was fun learning how to use Flexbox and saying good-bye to Float. jQuery is a handy tool to JavaScript. I think the joy and excitement of learning washed away the fear I had while facing countless challenges. Learning to code and debug to meet deadline is very rewarding to me.
